# About Me

_Story: Explore my evolution from a software engineer to product manager._

I began my career as a Software Engineer with a foundation in Computer Science Engineering and have since transitioned to Product Management to drive the development of impactful solutions at scale. My technical expertise enabled me to lead and architect key projects, including:
- NFL Analytics Web App: Directed the end-to-end development of a machine learning-powered analytical tool for NFL coaches, improving foul-play detection accuracy by 94.3%.
- AR Shopping Platform: Built a cloud-integrated data pipeline for an AR-based shopping app, leveraging Azure and Python to deliver seamless experiences.
- Enterprise Delivery Optimization: Enhanced real-time delivery updates by 70% for an enterprise solutions company, streamlining operations for over 400 clients.
With a robust background in software development and a strategic approach to product management, I bridge the gap between technical teams and business needs, delivering user-centric solutions with measurable outcomes.


# Something
> Armine and Tigran are part of a software development team tasked with creating a new mobile application. Armine is tasked with refining the user authentication system, while Tigran is implementing an innovative feature that allows users to share media within the app.
>
> **Without Version Control**: If Armine and Tigran are editing the same file, Tigran's latest upload could accidentally overwrite the changes Armine made, resulting in a loss of progress and potential conflicts in the code.
>
> **With Version Control**: Armine and Tigran can work on their updates concurrently without the risk of interfering with each other's contributions. Here's how it unfolds:
>
> - Independently, they make their changes and commit their updates to the version control system, each creating a new version in the repository.
>
> - The version control system alerts them to the presence of new, separate updates, signaling that a merge of changes is necessary.
>
> - Together, they examine the differences, carefully integrate their respective code changes, and commit the unified version to the repository.
>
> - Should an issue arise with the authentication update, Armine can revert her portion of the code to a previous state without disrupting Tigran's feature, thanks to the version history maintained by the system.

A common tool for version control is GitHub. GitHub allows you acts as a central hub for all of the different versions of your code, kind of how in google docs you can see the history of your changes. Though there are many different systems for version control, we will be learning using GitHubs features. The syntax and user interface of different products are different, but the core elements are the same.
