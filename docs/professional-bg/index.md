_Explore my evolution from a software engineer to product manager!_

I began my career as a Software Engineer with a foundation in Computer Science Engineering and have since transitioned to Product Management to drive the development of impactful solutions at scale. My technical expertise enabled me to lead and architect key projects, like the following:

## NFL Analytics Web App

I led the development of a $2M worth NFL Analytics Web App to address a key challenge faced by NFL strategists and coaches: efficiently identifying player foul activity without the need to manually review hours of game footage. Previously, coaches and analysts spent significant time analyzing videos to detect infractions, which delayed strategy formulation. By leveraging advanced machine learning models and cloud technologies, I spearheaded the creation of a web application processes gameplay videos uploaded by users and automatically detects foul play by analyzing video frames. It highlightes infractions with precision on the video and provides analysis of each player.

> **Impact Since Deployment**
> - Increased Accuracy: Improved foul-play detection accuracy by 94.3%, significantly enhancing decision-making during gameplay strategy sessions.
> - Time Savings: Eliminated hours of manual video review, saving time for coaches and analysts by 50% to focus on team development.
> - Scalability: The app's architecture supports the processing of high-resolution video data at scale, enabling use across multiple NFL teams and coaching staff.
>
> **Technology Stack**
> - Cloud Services: Microsoft Azure (Azure Functions, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Cosmos DB etc.)
> - RESTful APIs: Azure functions
> - Front-End: React.js
> - Back-End: Kubernetes, Docker
> - Machine Learning Models: You Only Look Once (YOLO) for object detection and TSM (Temporal Shifting Model) for foul-play recognition in video.
> - Database: NoSQL database via Azure Cosmos DB for metadata and frame management.

## AR Shopping Platform

The AR Shopping Platform reimagines how users interact with everyday products by providing an intuitive, immersive shopping experience through augmented reality (AR). Designed as a proof of concept for *Technovate Hackathon*, the platform demonstrates how AR can address accessibility challenges and bridge the gap between discovery and purchase. Users can scan physical items, view detailed product information in real-time, and add them directly to their cart, eliminating guesswork and enhancing decision-making. Additionally, a no-code platform empowers merchants to create and manage product catalogues seamlessly, allowing them to upload product details, visuals, and videos to deliver rich, accurate information to customers.

> **Impact Since Deployment**
> - Enhanced Accessibility: Simplifies the shopping experience for individuals with disabilities, showcasing how AR can provide intuitive navigation and improved product understanding.
> - Real-Time Engagement: Demonstrates the potential for instant product reordering, reducing the likelihood of forgotten purchases.
> - Improved Merchant Usability: Lowers the technical barrier for merchants with a no-code platform, enabling effortless catalog management.
> - Scalability: Highlights how cloud integration using Azure can ensure high availability and performance.
>
> **Technology Stack**
> - Augmented Reality Framework: Unity 3D with AR Foundation plugin.
> - Front-End: React.js (merchant-facing no-code platform).
> - Back-End: ASP.NET Core Framework for REST API development.
> - Cloud Services: Microsoft Azure Functions for serverless computing and data processing.
