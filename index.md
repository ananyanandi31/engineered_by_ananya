I’m a **Product Manager** with over two years of professional experience, delivering transformative outcomes across Sports, Fintech, E-Commerce, and Enterprise Solutions sectors. From building customized software solutions using machine learning to leading cross-functional teams, my work has created significant business impact and elevated user experiences. I was honoured with the Spotlight Award by NASSCOM for leading the development of an NFL® analytics web application, the first built on my company (Xoriant's) AI platform, unlocking dynamic use cases and predictive models.

## Back to School (Sept 2023 – June 2025)

I am pursuing a Master of Information Management at the **University of Washington**, where I’m exploring courses like Product Management and Strategy, Leadership, User Experience Design, Information Visualization, and Managerial Business Intelligence. This academic journey empowers me to bridge technical expertise with business strategy, enabling me to drive impactful product innovation and development at scale.

## Empowering Women in Tech

As the **Professional Development Committee Lead** at Grad SWE (Graduate Society of Women Engineers, UW), I’ve spearheaded initiatives empowering women in technology. Leading a team of 10+ dynamic women, I’ve organized impactful events like Speed Mentoring and Industrial Networking Happy Hour, positively influencing 100+ attendees by connecting them with industry professionals. My passion for fostering gender diversity in tech also led me to attend the **SWE24 Conference** in Chicago, a remarkable gathering of over 20,000 women engineers from diverse sectors. Engaging with industry leaders and hearing their inspiring stories redefined my perspective on resilience, determination, and the limitless potential of women in engineering.

## Leadership Through Community Impact

Beyond my professional and academic pursuits, I dedicated five years to **Rotaract**, a youth organization under Rotary International. As the District Rotaract Secretary, I managed **57 clubs**, orchestrated a **2,000+ attendee leadership conference**, and earned several prestigious awards for my contributions. From serving at old-age homes and conducting plantation drives to organizing fundraisers, food distributions, and cloth donation initiatives during the pandemic, I’ve witnessed firsthand the power of leadership and collective action. These experiences not only enhanced my organizational and people management skills but also deepened my understanding of how technology and strategic planning can bridge cultural divides and create lasting societal impact.

## Creativity Meets Business Acumen

In addition to my professional endeavors, I am a **small business owner**, running an Instagram-based art store where I create and sell customized paintings, portraits, sketches, and bookmarks. This venture combines my artistic passion with entrepreneurial expertise, requiring me to oversee marketing strategies, customer engagement, and operational workflows. Managing end-to-end processes—from market research and client interactions to timely delivery—has refined my ability to scale solutions and maintain customer satisfaction, skills that align closely with my product management ethos.
